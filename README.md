# LL-FreeRTOS-UART-Driver-for-STM32F411
Low-level FreeRTOS Driver library for a UART interface. Based on a STM32F411 microcontroller.

## Project Description
Project was concluded in March of 2024.
The project implements a Low-level FreeRTOS Driver library for a UART interface. Inc/USARTDrv.h and Src/USARTDrv.c provide the interface for the driver and Inc/MainDev.h and Src/MainDev.c provide an example of the drivers execution.
